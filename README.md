# Zero_Condition
Python script that parses through a pandas dataframe looking for 'quantity' and 'operation' in the attributes dictionary. Then it will append or add a '> 0 condition' to the conditions list on the specified unit code.
This script became critical for the decision tree developing process as it ensures a unit_code cannot populate with a zero value.
